Apart from gaining their right to vote there was also a great growing autonomy \n        in the tradidional roles they held in their households. \n\n        Women were making changes in every aspect of the lives they held ~ from their workplace, to their personal \n        relationships to their home lives, which were fueled by the previous treatment that society held against them. \n      </h45>\n        <i> “Men would go to the tavern, drink away mortgage money, drink so much they couldn’t go to work\n        the next day, beat their wives, abuse their children.

Before the 1920s women were forced to carry on stereotypical gender roles that\n         prevented them from having much freedom. After the suffrage  movement was passed in 1920, women became optimistic and venturous with their \n         new found freedom. Women started to dramatically shift the notion on how women should behave. Women started to become heavily involved in \n         politics by forming various parties including the National Woman's Party(NWP). The feminists movement originated during this time period, \n         which was a belief in the political, economic and cultural equality of women. This inturn led to the Progressive era, during this time white \n         women fought hard to break down barriers of oppression by pushing for equal rights and social reform. During a ten year span many women found \n         themselves in the U.S. House of Representatives, the senate, and various high ranking positions in government. They were able to make huge \n         strides by becoming a major contributor in educational reform, industrial reform, child health programs, and even had pensions for impoverished\n          dependent women. Woman groups lobbied for many different reforms and causes including the disarmament and the peace movement. This movement\n          was against violence and guns. Women were able to accomplish many tasks that seemed unachievable for many.\n      </p>\n      <img src=\"https://www.nps.gov/bepa/learn/images/Alice-Paul-raises-glass1az.jpg?maxwidth=1200&maxheight=1200&autorotate=false\"  className='shaan-image' alt=\"not working\"/>\n      <p>\n        The 1920s was also a time of  promiscuity, this lead to the first documented sex revolution of american history. Women no longer felt the need to be \"ladylike\", \n        instead women would go to bars, drink with the men, dress provocatively, and sometimes dance on tables. Women embodied new roles, fashion, lifestyle, etc.\n        that were radical to the original womanhood, this new generation became to be known as 'the new women'. Women no longer found the traditional motherhood\n        lifestyle glamourous. It was much cooler to go against those norms. Women started to have more sex, less marriages, and less babies. Most women avoided \n        motherhood all together by getting illegal abortions or taking contraceptives. Womens fashion made radical reforms during this era; a new style of dress was created\n        to be looser and reveal more skin. This dress became to be known as the flapper dress and it was one of the more popular outfits in this era.

In 1918, the 18th Amendment was passed which prohibited manufacturing,\n      transporting, or selling any alcohol beverages. The \"noble experiment\", as Hoover called it, did not last more than a decade. People soon\n      joined black markets to sell Alcohol, which gave rise to the concept of \"bootlegging\".
