It soon became the largest association for women in the United States. The women in the movement were inspired in the United States by the extreme drinking epidemic and the irrational ills that befell women whose husbands were drunkards. \nIt was seen as both a moral and domestic challenge, enabling women to unprecedentedly enter the political sphere .\nUnder the revolution, men were barred from voting and taking office, though they were asked to contribute financially. \nIn 1874, Annie Wittenmyer founded the Women's Christian Temperance Union. In 1879, the new president was Frances E. Willard, who remained president until her death. \nThe corporation did not concentrate only on temperance, but also encouraged other social restrictions and the issue of equality for women. \"These other problems were part of Willard's policy of \"Do Something.\nUnder a popular chief, Willard, the WCTU was organized, but had considerable autonomy for local chapters. In order to support the WCTU, Willard also traveled the country and visited local chapters. She visited Texas in 1882 and California in 1883. These visits stimulated rapid growth in membership growth. </p>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/Annie.jpg'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\">Annie Wittenmyer</h1>\n      <p>\n        Annie Wittenmyer was born Annie Turner in Ohio in 1827.

She was a founder of the Women's Temperance Union and President from 1879 until her death in 1898.\n        Willard was a very spiritual woman due to her upbringing and a brush with death when she was 19. She was very interested in the Women's Crusade, and eventually\n        became the President of the Chicago chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, despite a higher paying job offer at a college.\n        Five years later she was voted into the Presidency of the entire Women's Christian Temperance Union. As the President, she gained national recognition and was praised for her competence.\n        Frances Willard toured Texas in 1882 in order to organize WCTU chapters. It was at the end of a larger tour through the South. The movement struggled in the more conservative southern states,\n        but her tour garnered large crowds and some success.

Nation</h1>\n      <p>\n        Carrie Nation, originally Carrie Amelia Moore, was born in Kentucky in 1846. Her name is also sometimes spelled Carry.She is most famous for her extreme opposition of alcohol and taking action by destroying bars and saloons with a hatchet.\n        Carrie was very religious and would often pray or sing while swinging her hatchet across the United States. During her time and in history books, Carrie has been depicted as unnecessarily violent and domineering in her support of the Prohibition movement.\n        No group claims that she was a part of what they stood for (feminists, various Christian religions, the WCTU).\n        Carrie also published The Smasher’s Mail newspaper where people sent in their reactions to the destroying of saloons,\n        which Carrie saw as a noble cause. Some people praised her actions, while others were more than angry with the way she handled violations of the Prohibition.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/Pauline.jpg'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\">Pauline Morton Sabin</h1>\n      <p>\n        Pauline Morton Sabin was born in 1887 to a wealthy family. After her divorce and subsequent remarriage to Charles Hamilton Sabin, she became involved in charity and political work.\n        She organized Republican meetings and parties on her estate, leading her to eventually found the National Women’s Republican Club in 1921. She was the first woman to serve on the National Republican Committee.\n        She continued work in politics, eventually campaigning for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election. Her work in Prohibition was inspired by her distaste for the hypocrisy of politicians who supported Prohibition only\n        in public and the clear ineffectiveness of the law. She had supported Herbert Hoover, a Prohibitionist, but after his inaugural address decided to organize the anti-Prohibitionist women of America against the party’s platform.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div className=\"container\">\n\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/bootleg.jpg'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\">Bootleggers</h1>\n      <p>\n        In U.S. history, bootlegging was the illegal manufacture, transport, distribution, or sale of alcoholic beverages during the Prohibition period (1920–33), when those activities were forbidden under the Eighteenth Amendment (1919) to the U.S. Constitution.\n        Most recorded bootleggers were men involved in shady business that had connections to crime lords, but women were typically overlooked in\n        this particular practice. There were many female bootleggers, but only 173 individual cases were recorded. Of those recorded cases,\n        there were certain demographic patterns. Most female bootleggers were mothers who were trying to financially support their families,\n        whether they were widows or not. Mothers usually stayed home to take care of their children and brewing alcohol was not a challenge with privacy\n        and access to kitchens. A majority of female bootleggers were immigrants. They felt more justified in their actions since they had come from various\n        cultures that did not see\n        the creation or consumption of alcohol as an issue.[17]\n        When arrested for illegal sales of alcohol most women admitted to their actions, but appealed to the judge that their motives were to provide their children with basic necessities.\n        However, there was a high risk of mothers losing custody of their children when they were arrested, even if there was nobody left to care for them while their mother served a jail sentence.\n         </p>\n    </div >\n\n    <div className=\"container\">\n\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/saloon.jpg'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\">Changes in Social Life</h1>\n      <p>\n        Before Prohibition women generally stayed away from saloons and bars, mostly drinking behind the closed doors of their own homes. During Prohibition, however, women started occupying more public areas such as speakeasies. Breaking rules seemed to appeal to a large population of women and drinking in a public setting was no longer limited to those considered to have low morals.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/smasher.jpg'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\"> Reactions to the Movement</h1>\n      <p>\n        Reactions to the Movement\n        There were mixed reactions to the movement. Some thought that they were pursuing a noble cause, but others believed that Prohibition was a failure and an overreach on the part of the government.\n        The newspaper Carrie Nation was an editor for in Topeka, Kansas was titled The Smasher’s Mail and published scathing reviews of Nation's actions the first week of February, 1901. Some of those that wrote in claimed that God was in favor of saloons and criticized her for saying she was a follower of God. Others praised her for her actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/politics.png'></img>\n      <h1 className=\"title\">Prolitical Views, and Class Divides</h1>\n      <p>\n        Most African Americans opposed Prohibition. However, African American women felt that they needed to remain loyal to the Republican party that had put an end to slavery and gave them more rights as citizens. They were torn between their desire for alcohol and their loyalty to a party that supported the Prohibition. They also believed that the Democratic party was using their opposition to Prohibition to attract more African American voters which would eventually lead to the organization of oppression.[19]\n        Class Divides\n        There is controversy over class divides in the support for Prohibition. Some claim that working class-women supported Prohibition because they viewed alcohol as the vice keeping them in poverty. Their husbands would go and drink their money away, leaving them without the money to buy food and other supplies. Others claim that working-class women, along with their husbands, were for repeal because of the new power it gave to police forces to interfere with their lives.[20]\n      </p>\n    </div> */}\n  </div >\n\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
