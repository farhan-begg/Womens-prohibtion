Their goal was to end alcoholism as they saw it as a social ill. The Crusade was organized in Ohio in 1874 and created an opportunity for women to promote national temperance.

Hillsboro had moderate success, but it was after another one of Lewis\\u2019 lectures in Washington Court House, Ohio, that the movement really began to have success. After Hillsboro and Washington Court House, crusades erupted in small towns all over Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Nationwide a total of 750 breweries closed, and many shopkeepers pledged to sell alcohol only to those with prescriptions. The tactics of the movement involved picketing, praying and singing hymns publicly, marching in the streets, and asking for pledges from local shopkeepers and saloon owners. Saloons that were particularly harsh towards the crusaders would often have women stand in front of their doors, blocking entry, such was the case at a saloon in Adrian, Michigan after the saloon owner locked two of the women leaders in the saloon. Not all women supported the movement. Some women spat at the crusaders alongside their male companions, either because they felt it wasn't a woman's place to act so publicly, or because they didn't support temperance.

There were many female bootleggers, but only 173 individual cases were recorded. Of those recorded cases, there were certain demographic patterns. Most female bootleggers were mothers who were trying to financially support their families, whether they were widows or not. Mothers usually stayed home to take care of their children and brewing alcohol was not a challenge with privacy and access to kitchens. A majority of female bootleggers were immigrants. They felt more justified in their actions since they had come from various cultures that did not see the creation or consumption of alcohol as an issue.[17] When arrested for illegal sales of alcohol most women admitted to their actions, but appealed to the judge that their motives were to provide their children with basic necessities. However, there was a high risk of mothers losing custody of their children when they were arrested, even if there was nobody left to care for them while their mother served a jail sentence.[17] Changes in Social Life Before Prohibition women generally stayed away from saloons and bars, mostly drinking behind the closed doors of their own homes. During Prohibition, however, women started occupying more public areas such as speakeasies. Breaking rules seemed to appeal to a large population of women and drinking in a public setting was no longer limited to those considered to have low morals.[18] African American Women Bootlegging Out of the 173 cases of recorder female bootleggers, six of them were African American women. It is unknown as to why this ratio is low. African Americans generally opposed Prohibition, but there has been little investigation on their role in bootlegging. They were either majorly unrepresented, or they followed the law despite their general feelings about Prohibition.[17] Political Views Most African Americans opposed Prohibition. However, African American women felt that they needed to remain loyal to the Republican party that had put an end to slavery and gave them more rights as citizens. They were torn between their desire for alcohol and their loyalty to a party that supported the Prohibition. They also believed that the Democratic party was using their opposition to Prohibition to attract more African American voters which would eventually lead to the organization of oppression.[19] Reactions to the Movement There were mixed reactions to the movement. Some thought that they were pursuing a noble cause, but others believed that Prohibition was a failure and an overreach on the part of the government. The newspaper Carrie Nation was an editor for in Topeka, Kansas was titled The Smasher\\u2019s Mail and published scathing reviews of Nation's actions the first week of February, 1901. Some of those that wrote in claimed that God was in favor of saloons and criticized her for saying she was a follower of God. Others praised her for her actions.[11] Class Divides There is controversy over class divides in the support for Prohibition. Some claim that working class-women supported Prohibition because they viewed alcohol as the vice keeping them in poverty. Their husbands would go and drink their money away, leaving them without the money to buy food and other supplies. Others claim that working-class women, along with their husbands, were for repeal because of the new power it gave to police forces to interfere with their lives.[20]\")));\n}","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/nobleprince/dev/courses/womens-prohibition/src/components/pages/Farhan.js"],"names":["React","Farhan"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,cAAP;AAEA,eAAe,SAASC,MAAT,GAAkB;AAC/B,sBAAO;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;AAAsB,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,uBAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAFF,eAGE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wmBAHF,CAFK,eAgBL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,80DAFF,CAhBK,eA+BL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,y1CADF,CA/BK,eA4CL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,k2BADF,CA5CK,eAqDL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,6hBArDK,eA4DL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,uiCA5DK,eAqEL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,g5BArEK,eA6EL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,+KA7EK,eAiFL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,q2BAjFK,eAwFL;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yeAIE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,o5BAJF,eAaE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0jCAbF,eAoBE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wUApBF,eAwBE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,2/GAxBF,CAxFK,CAAP;AA4ID","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport './Farhan.css';\n\nexport default function Farhan() {\n  return <div className=\"Farhan\">\n\n    <div className=\"container\"\n    >\n      <img className=\"temp\" src='images/Temperance.jpg'></img>\n      <p>\n        The Temperance movement started before the Eighteenth Amendment.

Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        Time magazine cover July 18, 1932, featuring Pauline Morton Sabin, founder and head of the WONPR.\n        The Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform was organized on May 28th, 1929 in Chicago.\n        Five national committees were formed, including: Investigation, Publicity, Speakers’ Bureau, Legislative, and Membership.\n        The organization was financed by voluntary contributions and not membership dues. At their peak they had over a million members.\n        The primary founder, Pauline Morton Sabin, gathered the group following after Ella Boole proclaimed to Congress that she represented all women.\n        The WONPR's argument against Prohibition was its ineffectiveness and how it encouraged disrespect of the law and the Constitution.\n        Bootlegging was common, and once the Great Depression began, many were hoping simply for more jobs and the tax money that would come from legal selling of alcohol again.[15]\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        Some believed that the WONPR was simply an auxiliary of the AAPA (Association Against the Prohibition Amendment). However, they were independent groups, and differed in opinion on certain matters, such as the WONPR's general endorsement of the Democratic party after they added the wet plank to their platform during the 1932 election.[14]\n\n        After their organization, they supported the end of Prohibition through legal and political means. During the Presidential and Congressional campaigns of 1932, they supported those who supported repeal, regardless of which party they belong to. This was despite concerns that the WONPR would simply vote Democrat. For example, in the Senate race in California, the WONPR endorsed the wet Republican over the dry Democrat.[15]\n\n        The women in this organization were involved in conventions, met with politicians, and were present and involved in the state ratifying conventions which voted on ratification of the 21st Amendment, putting an end to Prohibition.[15] After the ratification of the 21st Amendment, the WONPR was dissolved.[14]\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        Molly Pitcher Clubs\n        There were many anti-Prohibition movements besides the Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform. The Association Against the Prohibition Amendment had female chapters they named Molly Pitcher Clubs. This club never gained much national recognition, and likely did not grow very large.[16]\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"container\">\n        Bootleggers\n        Most recorded bootleggers were men involved in shady business that had connections to crime lords, but women were typically overlooked in this particular practice. There were many female bootleggers, but only 173 individual cases were recorded. Of those recorded cases, there were certain demographic patterns. Most female bootleggers were mothers who were trying to financially support their families, whether they were widows or not. Mothers usually stayed home to take care of their children and brewing alcohol was not a challenge with privacy and access to kitchens. A majority of female bootleggers were immigrants. They felt more justified in their actions since they had come from various cultures that did not see the creation or consumption of alcohol as an issue.[17]\n\n        When arrested for illegal sales of alcohol most women admitted to their actions, but appealed to the judge that their motives were to provide their children with basic necessities. However, there was a high risk of mothers losing custody of their children when they were arrested, even if there was nobody left to care for them while their mother served a jail sentence.[17]\n\n        Changes in Social Life\n        Before Prohibition women generally stayed away from saloons and bars, mostly drinking behind the closed doors of their own homes. During Prohibition, however, women started occupying more public areas such as speakeasies. Breaking rules seemed to appeal to a large population of women and drinking in a public setting was no longer limited to those considered to have low morals.[18]\n\n        African American Women\n        Bootlegging\n        Out of the 173 cases of recorder female bootleggers, six of them were African American women. It is unknown as to why this ratio is low. African Americans generally opposed Prohibition, but there has been little investigation on their role in bootlegging. They were either majorly unrepresented, or they followed the law despite their general feelings about Prohibition.[17]\n\n        Political Views\n        Most African Americans opposed Prohibition. However, African American women felt that they needed to remain loyal to the Republican party that had put an end to slavery and gave them more rights as citizens. They were torn between their desire for alcohol and their loyalty to a party that supported the Prohibition. They also believed that the Democratic party was using their opposition to Prohibition to attract more African American voters which would eventually lead to the organization of oppression.[19]\n\n        Reactions to the Movement\n        There were mixed reactions to the movement. Some thought that they were pursuing a noble cause, but others believed that Prohibition was a failure and an overreach on the part of the government.\n\n        The newspaper Carrie Nation was an editor for in Topeka, Kansas was titled The Smasher’s Mail and published scathing reviews of Nation's actions the first week of February, 1901. Some of those that wrote in claimed that God was in favor of saloons and criticized her for saying she was a follower of God. Others praised her for her actions.[11]\n\n        Class Divides\n        There is controversy over class divides in the support for Prohibition. Some claim that working class-women supported Prohibition because they viewed alcohol as the vice keeping them in poverty. Their husbands would go and drink their money away, leaving them without the money to buy food and other supplies. Others claim that working-class women, along with their husbands, were for repeal because of the new power it gave to police forces to interfere with their lives.[20]\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
