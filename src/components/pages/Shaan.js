      <h1>The Broken Gener Barrier</h1>
      <p>
        The prohibition era was an era of radical reform for women. Before the 1920s women were forced to carry on stereotypical gender roles that
         prevented them from having much freedom. After the suffrage  movement was passed in 1920, women became optimistic and venturous with their 
         new found freedom. Women started to dramatically shift the notion on how women should behave. Women started to become heavily involved in 
         politics by forming various parties including the National Woman's Party(NWP). The feminists movement originated during this time period, 
         which was a belief in the political, economic and cultural equality of women. This inturn led to the Progressive era, during this time white 
         women fought hard to break down barriers of oppression by pushing for equal rights and social reform. During a ten year span many women found 
         themselves in the U.S. House of Representatives, the senate, and various high ranking positions in government. They were able to make huge 
         strides by becoming a major contributor in educational reform, industrial reform, child health programs, and even had pensions for impoverished
          dependent women. Woman groups lobbied for many different reforms and causes including the disarmament and the peace movement. This movement
          was against violence and guns. Women were able to accomplish many tasks that seemed unachievable for many.

        The 1920s was also a time of  promiscuity, this lead to the first documented sex revolution of american history. Women no longer felt the need to be "ladylike", 
        instead women would go to bars, drink with the men, dress provocatively, and sometimes dance on tables. Women embodied new roles, fashion, lifestyle, etc.
         that were radical to the original womanhood, this new generation became to be known as 'the new women'. Women no longer found the traditional 
         lifestyle glamourous. It was much cooler to go against those norms. Women started to have more sex, less marriages, and less babies. Most women avoided 
         motherhood all together by getting illegal abortions or taking contraceptives.
