      <p>
      <h45>There was a growing belief in the 19th century, that americans were leading a life that opposed American morals.</h45>
      people genuinely feared that America will not be blessed and that the whole system was in danger. This led to many reforms,
      including the temperance movement. This movement advocated for reduced consumption of alcohol, but also many advocated tol fully
      avoid drinking Alcohol. The American Temperance Society became the largest organization of its kind, and by the 1830's, it had over
      200,000 members

      <h1 className="title">Later years and 18th Amendment</h1>
      <p>From the 1830's until the 20th century, the temperance movement only gained momentum. At first it became succesfull on state levels,
      especially at rural south and western states, where it was associated with poverty and insanity. In the 20th century, it became a National
      movement, supported even by the middle class along with other 'progressive' movements. In 1918, the 18th Amendment was passed which prohibited manufacturing,
      transporting, or selling any alcohol beverages. The "noble experiment", as Hoover called it, did not last more than a decade. People soon
      joined black markets to sell Alcohol, which gave rise to the concept of "bootlegging". By the 1930's the 18th Amendment was repealed.
