      <h1 className="title"> Temperance Movement</h1>
      <p>
        The Temperance movement started before the Eighteenth Amendment. Across the country many people began arguing that alcohol was morally corrupting and hurting
        families economically. Claiming men would drink their family's money away. This temperance movement paved the way for some women to join the Prohibition movement,
        which they often felt was necessary due to their personal experiences dealing with drunk husbands and fathers. Also, it was one of the few ways for women to enter politics at the time.
        One of the most notable groups that pushed for Prohibition was the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. On the other end of the spectrum was the Women's Organizationfor National Prohibition Reform, who were instrumental in getting
        the 18th Amendment repealed. These women argued that Prohibition was a breach of the
        rights of American citizens and frankly ineffective due to the prevalence of bootlegging.

      <h1 className="title"> Women's Crusade</h1>

      <p>The Women's Crusade started before the Women's Christian Temperance Union.
      Their goal was to end alcoholism as they saw it as a social ill. The Crusade was organized in Ohio in 1874 and created an opportunity for women to promote national temperance.
      The movement started due to the lectures given by Dr. Diocletian Lewis, who told the story of his mother getting a saloon to close by praying and singing. Though his techniques had limited success at first.
      However, the movement began to have success in Hillsboro, Ohio, where men and women who heard his lecture excitedly decided to try his methods.
      Men provided financial and emotional support, but women were the face of the movement. Hillsboro had moderate success, but it was after another one of Lewis’ lectures in Washington Court House, Ohio, that the movement really began to have success.
      After Hillsboro and Washington Court House, crusades erupted in small towns all over Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.
      Nationwide a total of 750 breweries closed, and many shopkeepers pledged to sell alcohol only to those with prescriptions.
      The tactics of the movement involved picketing, praying and singing hymns publicly, marching in the streets, and asking for pledges from local shopkeepers and saloon owners.
      Saloons that were particularly harsh towards the crusaders would often have women stand in front of their doors, blocking entry, such was the case at a saloon in Adrian, Michigan after the saloon owner locked two of the women leaders in the saloon.
      Not all women supported the movement. Some women spat at the crusaders alongside their male companions, either because they felt it wasn't a woman's place to act so publicly, or because they didn't support
      temperance. Whatever the reason, many women and men saw drinking as a serious moral issue and supported the crusaders.

      <h1 className="title">Populist Party</h1>
      <p>
        The Populist party faced divisions within itself, but the majority of its members were individually for the Prohibition Reform. However, they never officially announced where they stood
        on their view of the movement as a collective group. Francis E. Willard was one of many who urged the Populist party to make an official statement. She tried to join the WCTU with the Prohibition party
        because they seemed to be making an impact on Populist members. She received opposition in her attempt because the Prohibition party didn't feel ready to support Women's Suffrage on top of what they were already trying to reform.
        However, the Populist party still had allies such as James Baird Weaver and Ignatius Donnelly who were in full support of both Prohibition and Women's Suffrage.
        The Women's Christian Temperance Union was organized on November 18, 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. It quickly became the largest women's organization in the United States.
        The women in the movement were inspired by the serious drinking problem in the United States and the disproportionate ills that come upon women whose husbands were drunkards.
        It was seen as both a moral and home issue, allowing women to join the political sphere in unprecedented ways.
        Men were barred from voting and holding office within the movement, though they were asked to contribute financially.

      <h1 className="title">The Women's Christian Temperance Union</h1>
      <p>
        The Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded by Annie Wittenmyer in 1874. In 1879 Frances E. Willard became the new president and remained president until her death. The organization did not purely focus on temperance, but also promoted other social controls and the issue of equality for women.
        These other issues were part of Willard's “Do Everything” policy.
        The WCTU was united under a common leader, Willard, but had significant autonomy for local chapters.
        Willard often traveled the country to promote the WCTU and visit local chapters. She visited Texas in 1882 and California in 1883.These visits inspired rapid membership growth.
        There were many women that gained prominence during the Prohibition era, whether supporting or fighting the 18th Amendment. Among them were Presidents and members of the WCTU, and founders of the WONPR.

      <p>
        Annie Wittenmyer was born Annie Turner in Ohio in 1827. After the Civil War, Annie aligned herself with the Women's Crusade.
        She went to a convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Women's Christian Temperance Union was formed and she was voted as the first official president.
        Annie worked closely with Frances Willard, who was the secretary. They had opposing views regarding the WCTU's involvement in women's suffrage, so Annie became president of a new faction,
        the Non-Partisan Women's Christian Temperance Union

        Frances Willard was born September 28, 1839 in New York. She was a founder of the Women's Temperance Union and President from 1879 until her death in 1898.
        Willard was a very spiritual woman due to her upbringing and a brush with death when she was 19. She was very interested in the Women's Crusade, and eventually
        became the President of the Chicago chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, despite a higher paying job offer at a college.
        Five years later she was voted into the Presidency of the entire Women's Christian Temperance Union. As the President, she gained national recognition and was praised for her competence.
        Frances Willard toured Texas in 1882 in order to organize WCTU chapters. It was at the end of a larger tour through the South. The movement struggled in the more conservative southern states,
        but her tour garnered large crowds and some success. It did not achieve long-term success and Texas prohibitionists maintained their separation from the northern based prohibition movement and Willard herself.

      <p>
        Carrie Nation, originally Carrie Amelia Moore, was born in Kentucky in 1846. Her name is also sometimes spelled Carry.She is most famous for her extreme opposition of alcohol and taking action by destroying bars and saloons with a hatchet.
        Carrie was very religious and would often pray or sing while swinging her hatchet across the United States. During her time and in history books, Carrie has been depicted as unnecessarily violent and domineering in her support of the Prohibition movement.
        No group claims that she was a part of what they stood for (feminists, various Christian religions, the WCTU).
        Carrie also published The Smasher’s Mail newspaper where people sent in their reactions to the destroying of saloons,
        which Carrie saw as a noble cause. Some people praised her actions, while others were more than angry with the way she handled violations of the Prohibition.

        Pauline Morton Sabin was born in 1887 to a wealthy family. After her divorce and subsequent remarriage to Charles Hamilton Sabin, she became involved in charity and political work.
        She organized Republican meetings and parties on her estate, leading her to eventually found the National Women’s Republican Club in 1921. She was the first woman to serve on the National Republican Committee.
        She continued work in politics, eventually campaigning for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election. Her work in Prohibition was inspired by her distaste for the hypocrisy of politicians who supported Prohibition only
        in public and the clear ineffectiveness of the law. She had supported Herbert Hoover, a Prohibitionist, but after his inaugural address decided to organize the anti-Prohibitionist women of America against the party’s platform.

      <h1 className="title">Bootleggers</h1>
      <p>
        In U.S. history, bootlegging was the illegal manufacture, transport, distribution, or sale of alcoholic beverages during the Prohibition period (1920–33), when those activities were forbidden under the Eighteenth Amendment (1919) to the U.S. Constitution.
        Most recorded bootleggers were men involved in shady business that had connections to crime lords, but women were typically overlooked in
        this particular practice. There were many female bootleggers, but only 173 individual cases were recorded. Of those recorded cases,
        there were certain demographic patterns. Most female bootleggers were mothers who were trying to financially support their families,
        whether they were widows or not. Mothers usually stayed home to take care of their children and brewing alcohol was not a challenge with privacy
        and access to kitchens. A majority of female bootleggers were immigrants. They felt more justified in their actions since they had come from various
        cultures that did not see
        the creation or consumption of alcohol as an issue.[17]
        When arrested for illegal sales of alcohol most women admitted to their actions, but appealed to the judge that their motives were to provide their children with basic necessities.
        However, there was a high risk of mothers losing custody of their children when they were arrested, even if there was nobody left to care for them while their mother served a jail sentence.

      <h1 className="title">Changes in Social Life</h1>
      <p>
        Before Prohibition women generally stayed away from saloons and bars, mostly drinking behind the closed doors of their own homes. During Prohibition, however, women started occupying more public areas such as speakeasies. Breaking rules seemed to appeal to a large population of women and drinking in a public setting was no longer limited to those considered to have low morals.

        Reactions to the Movement
        There were mixed reactions to the movement. Some thought that they were pursuing a noble cause, but others believed that Prohibition was a failure and an overreach on the part of the government.
        The newspaper Carrie Nation was an editor for in Topeka, Kansas was titled The Smasher’s Mail and published scathing reviews of Nation's actions the first week of February, 1901. Some of those that wrote in claimed that God was in favor of saloons and criticized her for saying she was a follower of God. Others praised her for her actions.</p>

      <h1 className="title">Prolitical Views, and Class Divides</h1>
      <p>
        Most African Americans opposed Prohibition. However, African American women felt that they needed to remain loyal to the Republican party that had put an end to slavery and gave them more rights as citizens. They were torn between their desire for alcohol and their loyalty to a party that supported the Prohibition. They also believed that the Democratic party was using their opposition to Prohibition to attract more African American voters which would eventually lead to the organization of oppression.[19]
        Class Divides
        There is controversy over class divides in the support for Prohibition. Some claim that working class-women supported Prohibition because they viewed alcohol as the vice keeping them in poverty. Their husbands would go and drink their money away, leaving them without the money to buy food and other supplies. Others claim that working-class women, along with their husbands, were for repeal because of the new power it gave to police forces to interfere with their lives.[20]
