      The social movement behind Prohibition had been brewing since the mid-19th century, and gender dynamics had always been part of it.
      “Men would go to the tavern, drink away mortgage money, drink so much they couldn’t go to work the next day, beat their wives, abuse 
      their children. That’s what launched the beginning of the temperance movement,” Daniel Okrent, former Time Inc. editor-at-large and 
      author of Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition, recently told TIME.

      <h1 className="title">U.S. Attorney General Mabel Walker Willebrandt</h1>
      <p>As the highest-ranking woman in the federal government back then 
        and one of the first women appointed to a sub-Cabinet position, she
        oversaw Prohibition through three presidential administrations. The
        media called her “Prohibition Portia” and “Mrs. Firebrand,” and she 
        made the cover of TIME in 1929. She didn’t come from a temperance 
        background and didn’t make statements linking Prohibition to feminism, 
        but she acknowledged the key role that women have played in ridding society 
        of vice. “Women must use the scrubbing brush and soap,” she said in a 1924 
        Buffalo Enquirer article headlined “Women Alone Can Rid Cities of Vice, 
        Says Women Asst. Atty. Gen.”
