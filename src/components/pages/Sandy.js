      <p>
      <h45>The social movement behind Prohibition, which had been brewing since the mid-19th century, 
        held a big focal point in gender dynamics between men and women. The whole movement
        generated many changes in the public, private and politcal lives of women. 

        During the 1919 women helped pass the Prohibition Admendment granting them the right to vote in 1920.
        This great advancement in their basic human rights perhaps also inspired them to look into their other 
        parts of their lives. Apart from gaining their right to vote there was also a great growing autonomy 
        in the tradidional roles they held in their households. 

        Women were making changes in every aspect of the lives they held ~ from their workplace, to their personal 
        relationships to their home lives, which were fueled by the previous treatment that society held against them.

        <i> “Men would go to the tavern, drink away mortgage money, drink so much they couldn’t go to work
        the next day, beat their wives, abuse their children. That’s what launched the beginning of the
        temperance movement,” Daniel Okrent, author of Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.

        This launched American women to path new ways.

      <h1 className="title">Making Way For Women's Rights: <i>U.S. Attorney General Mabel Walker Willebrandt</i></h1>
      <p>As the highest-ranking woman in the federal government back then 
        and one of the first women appointed to a sub-Cabinet position, she
        oversaw Prohibition through three presidential administrations. The
        media called her “Prohibition Portia” and “Mrs. Firebrand,” and she 
        made the cover of TIME in 1929. She didn’t come from a temperance 
        background and didn’t make statements linking Prohibition to feminism, 
        but she acknowledged the key role that women have played in ridding society 
        of vice. “Women must use the scrubbing brush and soap,” she said in a 1924 
        Buffalo Enquirer article headlined “Women Alone Can Rid Cities of Vice, 
        Says Women Asst. Atty. Gen.”
